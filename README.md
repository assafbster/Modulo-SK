# Modulo-SK
Implementation of the Modulo-SK algorithm used for AWGN with noisy feedback

The Algorithm is described in the following paper:
Assaf Ben-Yishai  and Ofer Shayevitz. "Interactive schemes for the AWGN channel with noisy feedback." IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 63.4 (2017): 2409-2427.

The setup is of one-way communication, from Terminal A to Terminal B, over AWGN with noisy feedback.
